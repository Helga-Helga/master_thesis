Binocular stereo vision problem is one of the topical issues
of computer vision.
It underlies the construction of a depth map to obtain a three-dimensional model
of an object or surface.

This study aims to develop a method
for accelerating stereo vision algorithms using preliminary image segmentation.

To perform the study
\begin{itemize}
  \item information from geometry
        in computer vision was used to state the problem correctly;
  \item information from optimization theory and
        min-sum diffusion algorithm were used to solve an optimization problem;
  \item relaxation labeling algorithm was used to find the best depth map after
        solving the optimization problem.
\end{itemize}
